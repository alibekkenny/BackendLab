                Purpose of the application and the website SkillCheck:
            </div>
            <p>Nowadays, there are many methods of learning new material: from offline learning basic disciplines at school with a teacher, to online courses where you can learn things that interest you (such as hacking courses on skillbox). In order to
                solve the problem of finding people with a decent amount of skills, we can create a mobile application for that purpose. Our mobile application will look like a tinder app(in terms of system). So, basically we will create a profile-based
                mobile app on android OS. Person will create a profile with skills that he advanced in. For presenting it properly, we will create a web site which will also have a little part of the functionality of app. On the site you will be able
                to create profile, check info about product, and install the app itself. Also, part of the monetization will also be included into site and realized as subscription.
